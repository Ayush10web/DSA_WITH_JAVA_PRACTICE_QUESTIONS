# DSA_WITH_JAVA_PRACTICE_QUESTIONS
Here i will be solving all the major questions on Leet code, Codeforces and many platform questions along with some dsa sheet solutions.
My purpose of making this repository is to document my dsa learning and journey and when ever i feel demotivatred or distracted this repo will make me accountable for my failure.
So lets hope and pray to god that my journey reaches to the happy shore and if it so it will be worth sharing and will be inspiration for many of the forks like me out there
